# User Guide

Hey there, genius! This is your guide to navigating the 'pest-to-invest' software, just like I navigate through my crazy inventions. So strap on your jetpack and let's blast off!

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Just like cloning Goddard, but easier! Use the command `git clone <repository_url>` to create a local copy of the codebase.

2. **Install Dependencies**: It's like gathering parts for a new invention. Use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary Python packages.

3. **Set Up OpenAI API Key**: This is the secret ingredient to our invention, like the flux capacitor in a time machine! Follow the instructions in the OpenAI documentation to set up your API key.

4. **Prepare Investor Information**: Gather the data about the investors you want to communicate with. This should be in a CSV file with columns for Name, Company Name, and Email.

5. **Customize Email Templates**: Make it your own! Open the `templates.py` file and modify the email templates to fit your style.

6. **Create Your Signature**: Every great inventor has a signature, and so should you! Open the `email_signature.txt` file and add your name, title, and contact information.

## Running the Program

To run the program, use the command `python3 main.py --file <csv_file> --temperature <temperature> --max_tokens <max_tokens> --mode <mode> --reply_speed <reply_speed> --custom_prompt <custom_prompt> --test`. Each option is like a dial on one of my inventions, allowing you to fine-tune the output to your liking.

## Security Considerations

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Be sure to secure your sensitive information, like your OpenAI API key and email credentials. It's like locking up the lab when you're done for the day.
